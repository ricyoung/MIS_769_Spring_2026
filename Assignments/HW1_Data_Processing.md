2. **Load and explore** datasets using Pandas
3. **Assess data quality** by identifying missing values, duplicates, and outliers
4. **Discover and communicate** an interesting finding from data

## How You'll Be Graded

| Component | Points | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **Data Connection** | 5 | Successfully load data from any source into a Pandas DataFrame |
| **Data Exploration** | 5 | Answer basic questions about your dataset's structure and content |
| **Quality Assessment** | 5 | Complete analysis of missing values, duplicates, and outliers |
| **Interesting Finding** | 5 | One insight with evidence and business relevance |
| **Total** | **20** | |

---

## What to Do

1. **Open the starter notebook** in Google Colab
2. **Choose a data source** (HuggingFace, Kaggle, or your own CSV)
3. **Run the exploration code** and answer the questions in markdown cells
4. **Complete the data quality assessment**
5. **Find something interesting** and write up your insight

---

## What Counts as "Interesting"?

Your finding should be something that would matter to a business:

- An unexpected distribution ("90% of reviews are 5-stars")
- A surprising correlation ("longer reviews tend to be more negative")
- A pattern ("complaints spike on Mondays")
- An anomaly ("one product has 10,000 reviews")

Write 3-5 sentences explaining: what you found, why it matters, and what evidence supports it.
